# Breast Cancer Prediction

The primary goal for my CSCA 5622 Final is to identify the most significant and/or correlated features that are associated with breast cancer diagnoses and gain a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to the diagnosis of breast cancer.

By identifying which features are most prominent, we can then use machine learning models to predict whether or not a person has breast cancer. The models are trained and evaluated based on their ability to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). We will compare 4 models' performance along with an ensemble method.

Through this comparative analysis, we aim to determine which model performs best in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics and convey how machine learning could aid in the early detection and treatment of breast cancer, thereby improving patient outcomes.
